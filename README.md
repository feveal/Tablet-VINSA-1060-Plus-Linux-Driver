Linux driver for the VINSA 1600 Plus drawing tablet with full pressure sensitivity and button support.

The [marvinbelfort](https://github.com/marvinbelfort) driver has been adapted and expanded for this graphics tablet, improving sensitivity and providing two modes of use: one mouse-like, which uses a smaller area of â€‹â€‹the tablet and is also customizable according to preferences, and another tablet-like mode, which occupies the entire area and offers greater sensitivity for artistic drawing.

- The "B" button toggles between Mouse/Tablet modes.
- The "[" and "]" buttons expand and contract the working area in mouse mode.

## âœ¨ Features
-  Full pressure support (8192 levels)
-  Adjustable sensitivity settings
-  Mouse/Tablet mode toggle (B button)
-  Dynamically adjustable work area ([ ] buttons)
-  All programmable buttons
-  No sudo required (udev rules included)
-  Desktop launcher with custom icon
